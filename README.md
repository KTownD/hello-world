# hello-world
This is my first repository to help me learn how to use GitHub

It's kinda crazy I suppose how long it has taken me to learn so many of these online tools that are designed to help me become a better software developer. On the one hand it is super-embarassing. On the other hand, I just have to get on with it. There's no going back.
Just keep moving forward, a little bit at a time, sometimes a spurt of running, and sometimes a day of rest. 
But the overall picture will show progress. Whether it is learning Chinese, or getting good enough to sell your skills somewhere, or maybe even just figuring out how GitHub works!
